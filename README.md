## ðŸ“– Overview

This work proposes a novel algorithmic framework to capture the **convergence characteristics** of **Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent (D-SGD) with partial node participation**. Our framework unifies a large variety of D-SGD methods and enables a theoretical analysis that quantifies the effect of **node sampling** and **network topology** on the convergence rate.

Our key contributions are:
1.  A unified theorem for the theoretical convergence rate under the proposed framework.
2.  Empirical validation justifying the tightness of our theoretical results.

This project was conducted as a semester project at the [Machine Learning and Optimization Lab (MLO), EPFL](http://mlo.epfl.ch/), and led to a 1st-author publication at the NeurIPS 2022 Workshop on Optimization for Machine Learning.

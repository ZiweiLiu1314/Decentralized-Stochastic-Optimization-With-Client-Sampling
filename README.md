# Opt4MLProject

This is the code repository for my semester project at Machine Learning and Optimization lab, EPFL, during my master's study at EPFL. Our work led to a publication at NeurIPS workshop: Optmization in Machine Learning, <Decentralized Stochastic Optimization with Client Sampling>, me as the first author.
